# MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Analysis-Project
Created models using K-Nearest-Neighbors, K-Means, MultiPerception Layers, and a Convolutional Neural Network to analyze the MNIST Handwritten Digits '

Users can pick of the which of the following models to choose from to specifiy the accuracy of each model against each other. A confusion matrix is created as well to demonstrate the percentage of accuracy of each model.
